## Introduction

The code consists of three parts:  

1. Hardware source programs written by Verilog HDL for intel FPGA cyclone III and V.  
2. Machine learning scripts implemented by Python 3 and the Proof-of-Concept data.  
3. SPI receiver programs implemented by C for receiving the raw delay-time data.  

## Python Version

3.8.6  

## Quartus Version

Quartus Prime (v17.0.0 Lite Edition)  

## Usage (machine learning)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/shuji-oh/PLI_TDC_for_CAN  
$ cd PLI_TDC_for_CAN  
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt  
$ cd machine_learning/prototype  
$ python3 rf.py  
```
